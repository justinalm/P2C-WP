    <h2 class="vision">our vision <span class="icon">M</span></h2>
    <p class="headline">P2C+ Conference brings together students from across Canada to inspire and equip them to change the world. Our prayer is that this conference will open your eyes to the explosive possibilities God is holding out to you if you choose to make the decision to live completely for Him! The speakers, seminars and outreach opportunities throughout the week will help you gain a greater understanding of who Jesus is and the impact of the mission He left us, as believers, to go and make disciples of all nations.</p>
